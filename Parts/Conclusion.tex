Lissajous curves were first discovered over 200 years ago, and the way that we study them has continually evolved. They affect our style of art, our engineering, and our study of astronomy and physics. Lissajous curves can be made both digitally-oscilloscopes, online programs- and physically-Lissajous apparatus, and harmanographs. The images created can be analyzed through the parameterization of the Lissajous curves, as well as the line integrals. Though there is a difference between ideal and the real world, meaning that dampening would need to be considered in the calculations for the curves created by that of physical models.
